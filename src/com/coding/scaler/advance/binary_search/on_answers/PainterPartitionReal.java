     * Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N.
     * Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
     *
     * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1].
     * There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
     *
     * Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints
     * that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
     *
     * Input:
     *      arr= [5,3,6,1,9]
     *      B = 2; //painter given
     *
     * If Job can be taken by one painter: [10, 6, 12, 2, 18] = 48
     *
     * If we apply 2 painter then partition can be:
     *      Max[ (10) , (6 + 12 + 2 + 18)] = 38
     *      Max[ (10 + 6) , (12 + 2 + 18)] = 32
     *      Max[ (10 + 6 + 12) , (2 + 18)] = 28
     *      Max[ (10 + 6 + 12 + 2) , (18)] = 30
     *
     *      Min(38, 32, 28, 30) = 28
     *
     *      If we apply 3 painter then partition can be:
     *      T = [10, 6, 12, 2, 18] = [[10,6], [12, 2], [18]] => min = 18
     *
     *      Next, we increase painter to 4 the time will still be : 18
     *
     *  Output: 18
     *
     *  That means, we have to search an answer in range of approx [ 1...SumOf(T[]) ] and find Min. time where
     *  Painter are less than equals to A.
