     * You're given a read-only array of N integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than N/3
     * times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
     * If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.
     * <p>
     * If there are multiple solutions, return any one.
     * <p>
     * Input 1:
     * [1 2 3 1 1]
     * <p>
     * Output 1:
     * 1
     * <p>
     * Observation: How many integers can occur more than floor(N/3) times in the given array:
     * <p>
     * If we closely observe, in the given array, there can be a maximum of two integers that can
     * occur more than floor(N/3) times. Letâ€™s understand it using the following scenario:
     * <p>
     * Assume there are 8 elements in the given array. Now, if there is any majority element,
     * it should occur more than floor(8/3) = 2 times. So, the majority of elements should occur
     * at least 3 times. Now, if we imagine there are 3 majority elements, then the total occurrence
     * of them will be 3X3 = 9 i.e. greater than the size of the array. But this should not happen.
     * <p>
     * That is why there can be a maximum of 2 majority elements when calculated for N/3 times.
