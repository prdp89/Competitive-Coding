Lastly here is a list of LeetCode problems that can be solved using the trial and error algorithm (you're welcome to add more examples):

786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction

774 Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station

719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance

668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table

644. Maximum Average Subarray II

378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

Anyway, this post is just a reminder to you that the trial and error algorithm is worth trying if
you find all other common solutions suffer severely from bad time or space performance. Also it's
always recommended to perform a quick evaluation of the search space size and potential verification
algorithm to estimate the complexity before you are fully committed to this algorithm.
